<li>In Natural Language Processing, language identification is a task of predicting the language present in a document based on the contents of the document.</li>
We often encounter chrome showing a popup to translate a webpage when it detects that the content is not in English.
It is important to know which language the text is in, so that the other actions(i.e. text  generation, translation, text summarization) can be performed better.
Language Identification is the prerequisite for the text analysis. It identifies language in the content & improves the search results.
